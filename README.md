# Temptation Logger

A tool that logs information on moments of **temporary** weakness.

Breaking a bad habit can be really hard at the **beginning**, since you are still going through the process of internalizing the identity change.

After months pass without a certain behavior being performed, it starts to become clear to the mind that said behavior isn't needed.

Temptation logger allows you to gather information on these moments so you can have insights based on your behavior patterns, allowing you to optimize your system and remove environment cues that make the initial process of habit change harder.

## Information Gathering

Temptation Logger creates an entry in your logs with the following information:

- **Date** - The day of the year.
- **Time** - The moment the entry is created (when you initialize temptation logger). This means that when you have the temptation, you should create an entry as soon as possible.
- **Date of the Week**
- **Temptation** - The behavior you are being tempted to do. 
- **Cue** - The thing that triggered the temptation. What were you doing when the urge to break the habit arised?
- **Intensity** - In a scale from 1 to 5, how intense is the temptation?
- **Description (Optional)** - Describe what is going through your head and what are you feeling.
